The code in this repository is a simple implementation of the strategies presented in our paper,

# A Taxonomy of Interactive Online Machine Learning Strategies

In the example code [this datset](https://github.com/ategen/synthetic-dataset) is used, but if you want to use other datasets, you can include them through dataset_loading.py
After adding a dataset, run the following commands:
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main_template.py
```
In the above example, Python 3 is used.
